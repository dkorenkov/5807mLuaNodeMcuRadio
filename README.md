# 5807mLuaNodeMcuRadio
5807m Lua NodeMcu FM Radio with REST API and web control

Since NODEMCU developers are not much concerned about backward compatibility, it works only on a specific version of nodemcu.

 Feel free updating the code to fit your version of NodeMcu. You are welcome to check in your changes. I have no further plans for this code.


You may use it as a sample to start 5807m support. 
RDS functionazlity is commented out because it require some debugging.
